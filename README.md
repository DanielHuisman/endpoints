## What is it?
A pluggable hypermedia API framework compatible with any node http server or
data store.

Endpoints comes with a built in formatter for the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org)
specification, a storage adapter for [Bookshelf](http://bookshelfjs.org/), and
http adapters for Express, Hapi and Koa.

*Check out the [example implementation](https://github.com/endpoints/example).*

## Roadmap
This project is currently under heavy development. If you wish to use this in a
production environment, you'll want to track the commit history closely.

At the time of this writing, performance is **not** a concern of this project.
